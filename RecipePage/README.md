# Recipe Page Challenge

![Recipe Page](recipe-page-screenshot.png)

This project is my solution to the "Recipe Page" challenge from Frontend Mentor. The challenge was to build a recipe page according to the provided design, focusing on achieving a close resemblance to the design and using any tools or frameworks desired. I chose to use Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Description

The Recipe Page Challenge project is my implementation of the Frontend Mentor challenge. The main objective was to create a visually appealing recipe page following the provided design. While the project may not be pixel-perfect, the focus was on completing the challenge and learning from the process. Additionally, I plan to add more functionality to the page, such as a search feature for other recipes in the future.

## Features

- **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: Utilized Tailwind CSS for styling the recipe page.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the page is responsive across different devices and screen sizes.
