# QR Code Component Card

This project is a Frontend Mentor challenge completion where I created a QR code component card. Additionally, I've added a feature to generate QR codes from text input.

## Description

The QR Code Component Card project is my implementation of the Frontend Mentor challenge. The main objective was to create a visually appealing card component with a QR code image embedded. Furthermore, I extended the functionality by incorporating a feature to dynamically generate QR codes from user input text.

## Features

- **Static QR Code Card**: Displays a static QR code card layout as per the challenge requirements.
- **Dynamic QR Code Generation**: Allows users to input text, generating a QR code dynamically based on the input.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (for QR code generation)

## Usage

To view the QR Code Component Card project, simply navigate to the project folder and open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Enter text into the input field below the card to generate a QR code dynamically.
